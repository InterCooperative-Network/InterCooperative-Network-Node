Proof of Work Removal: All references to PoW, including mining difficulty and related methods, have been removed from the blockchain implementation.
Integration with Consensus: The blockchain is now fully integrated with the Proof of Cooperation (PoC) consensus mechanism, which is energy-efficient and better suited to the project's goals.
Updated Tests: Test cases have been updated to reflect the removal of PoW and to test the new PoC-based blockchain operations.
Network Updates: The network module has been revised to work with the new consensus model and maintain efficient peer-to-peer communication and gossip protocol. (1031884)

Refactor blockchain implementation and improve modularity

- Migrated core blockchain functionality to blockchain.rs, consolidating
  block and transaction management, chain validation, and consensus integration.
- Updated lib.rs to serve as the main entry point, initializing the blockchain
  and consensus mechanisms, and referencing the newly modularized components.
- Created asset_tokenization.rs for handling asset tokenization within the blockchain.
- Created transaction_validator.rs to handle transaction validation, including
  checks for double spends, sufficient balances, and signature verification.
- Retained and enhanced all original functionality, including signature handling
  and consensus operations, while improving code organization and modularity.
- Added comprehensive tests across all modules to ensure reliability and coverage.

Breaking change: The structure of the blockchain module has been significantly
refactored. This will require updates to any dependent modules or external
references to the blockchain functionality. (2c3b9e2)
