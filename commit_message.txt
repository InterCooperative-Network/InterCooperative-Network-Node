Implement error handling and networking security

- Added a consistent error handling system across crates using
  a custom IcnError type and IcnResult result type.
- Refactored code to propagate errors instead of panicking.
- Added TLS encryption to peer communication in the networking
  module to ensure secure data transmission.
- Fully integrated various modules within the ModuleCoordinator
  to ensure smooth startup and operation of the ICN node.
- Added detailed comments to the codebase for better understanding.
- Created update_project.sh script to handle git commits.

This commit improves overall stability, security, and maintainability
of the project while laying the groundwork for further enhancements.
