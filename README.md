# InterCooperative Network (ICN)

## Introduction

The **InterCooperative Network (ICN)** is an advanced decentralized platform designed to support cooperative economics, governance, and community management through a blockchain-based infrastructure. ICN enables the creation and management of cooperatives and communities, offering a decentralized framework for handling various economic, governance, identity, and reputation systems. The network is built using Rust for performance and security, with an emphasis on cooperative principles and democratic decision-making.

## Features

- **Modular Architecture**: The project is divided into various crates/modules, each handling specific aspects like blockchain, consensus, identity, governance, and more.
- **Blockchain Infrastructure**: A robust and scalable blockchain system supporting asset tokenization, smart contracts, and decentralized applications (dApps).
- **Consensus Mechanisms**: Implements innovative consensus algorithms, including Proof of Cooperation (PoC) and Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT).
- **Identity Management**: Decentralized identity (DID) system for secure and verifiable identities within the network.
- **Reputation System**: Integrated reputation system to ensure trustworthy interactions and decision-making within the network.
- **Governance and Voting**: Democratic governance with proposal creation, voting mechanisms, and execution of community decisions.
- **Developer-Friendly API**: Exposes APIs for interacting with the network, including transaction handling, proposal management, and identity creation.
- **Scalability and Sharding**: Supports sharding for improved scalability and performance.
- **Privacy and Security**: Advanced security measures including zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) and encryption to ensure data privacy and integrity.

## Project Status

**Note:** The InterCooperative Network (ICN) is currently under active development and is not yet functional. The project is in the early stages, and many components are still being implemented. As such, compiling the codebase will not yield a fully operational system at this time.
